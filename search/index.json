[{"content":"🎉 Welcome to AB Lab by Abdullah! 🎉 Hello and welcome to AB Lab! If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering about the name, it\u0026rsquo;s a fun play on words. \u0026lsquo;AB Lab\u0026rsquo; can be seen as a short form for \u0026lsquo;Abdullah\u0026rsquo;s Lab\u0026rsquo;, as well as a nod to the tech industry\u0026rsquo;s A/B testing. Can interpret this blog as A Blab 😜. But no matter how you interpret it, you\u0026rsquo;re here and I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to have you!\n🤓 Who Am I? 🤓 I\u0026rsquo;m Abdullah, a software engineer currently wearing the hat of a Jr. Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) / Platform Engineer. For the past 2 years, I\u0026rsquo;ve delved into the world of platform engineering. I am always excited to read about and play with new tools! From understanding DevOps culture and learning new technical tools included in CI/CD, to honing the softer skills of the domain, every day has been a thrilling ride. In my free time, you\u0026rsquo;ll often find me writing on this blog, exploring DevOps tools, or getting engrossed in best practices for SREs, Platform Engineering, and DevOps.\n🚀 Why AB Lab? 🚀 The idea behind this blog is simple: to share (give back to the great community), inspire, and grow together.\nSharing Knowledge 💡: As I navigate the landscape of SRE and DevOps, and Platform engineering. I gathered insights, best practices, and, yes, lessons from \u0026ldquo;occasional\u0026rdquo; missteps. This blog is my platform to share those with you.\nCertification Chronicles 🏆: I\u0026rsquo;ve ventured into various technical certifications, from CKA, RHCSA, CKAD, to GCP certificates. And with the goal of doing even more! such as: Terraform, GitOps, RHCA, and beyond. Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll detail my experiences, the highs, the challenges, and everything in between.\nCourses and Bootcamps 📚: As I continue my never-ending learning journey, expect to see in-depth discussions about courses, bootcamps, books, and other learning avenues that helped me with my journey and in achieving certification / goals.\nInspiration 💭: The core goal of AB Lab is to inspire. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re here to pick up a technical trick, insights for a certification, or just to explore the world of DevOps, I hope you leave with a renewed passion.\n🤔 Why Now? 🤔 For as long as I can remember, there\u0026rsquo;s been a bit of hesitation when it came to putting myself out there in the vast expanse of the internet. It\u0026rsquo;s one thing to learn and quite another to share that learning in a public domain, inviting both friends and strangers alike into my thought space. But here I am, ready to break out of my shell, eager to forge connections, be an active member of the tech community. The idea of sharing my insights or thoughts publicly was once a daunting prospect. But inspiration, especially from great bloggers like Justin Garrison, has propelled me to break out of my shell and share my tech realm with all of you.\n🌱 Looking Ahead 🌱 As we journey ahead, anticipate articles on SRE best practices, deep dives into DevOps tools and processes, tales of tech certifications, and much more. And while these are the core themes, anticipate occasional surprises!\nThank you for embarking on this journey with me.
